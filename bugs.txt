AccountTest
testAccountNumber - allows camel case account numbers (ie. aBc123).
testAddToBalance - allows using 0.00 as a parameter to add to balance.
testSubtractFromBalance - allows using 0.00 as a parameter to subtract from balance.
testBadConstructorParam - didn't throw exception when account number parameter was null or blank.
testBadConstructorName - expected an illegalargumentexception but didn't get one.

CustomerTest
SetFirstName - allows first name to be set as a string with number (ie. "123")

SetLastName - allows last name to be set with a camel case string (ie. "FrAsEr")
SetLastName - allows last name to be set with a space in the name (ie. "F raser")
SetPasscode - allowed me to set passcode to "a" -- should probably require more characters
SetPasscode - allowed me to set passcode to space in it (ie. aaa 111)

BankTest
not entirely sure I did the testing property for displaying to string info. when I tried testing like this:
assertEquals(bank.displaycustomerinformation(customer1), customer1.toString()); my assertEquals would error out.

testCloseAccount - when removing a single customer by account number it seems to be deleting all the customers in the hashmap.
